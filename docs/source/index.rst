   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

hackytools is only meant to be a collection of (hacky) convenience tools.

Please forgive my lacking documentation, as I'm trying to make the switch to Sphinx. Proper documentation and whatnot will come very soon. Maybe in the next point release.

Features
--------

- `@timeit` function decorator to time your functions
- Spritesheet/stylesheet generator (mainly for subreddit CSS) (CLI-based)
- CLI command `whatsmyip` to output your public IP address

Installation
------------

Install `hackytools` via pip:

`pip install hackytools`

Or for the development version (usually):

`pip install https://github.com/h4cky54ck/hackytools/archive/main.zip`

Support
-------

If you find a bug, please open an issue so that I (or someone, hopefully) can investigate as soon as possible.
